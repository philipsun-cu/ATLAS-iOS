### Assignment: UX/UI Criticism

**Due Monday, October 3**

1. **Identify a UI/UX problem or bug in any piece of software, but preferably a mobile app.**

Demonstrate the problem in a short video. Provide suggestions for improvement
and propose how it could be fixed.  Discuss trade-offs involved in different
approaches.

2. **Identify and share one delightful or thoughtful piece of interface design.**

Show it off in a short video. Explain why you like it or what's good about it.

3. **Upload the videos** to your personal project repo, or anywhere they can be
   accessed publicly — like a unlisted YouTube video. Post the links
   in your repo README.

4. **Be prepared to present** the videos to the class on Monday. You can say a
   few words in class, or otherwise make sure your video contains everything you
   want to share. You may be able to plug in your computer to the display if
   needed.


You can [record your screen on iOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935)
from the Control Center. Note that if you long-press on the record button in
Control Center, you can choose whether to include the microphone in the recording or
not.
