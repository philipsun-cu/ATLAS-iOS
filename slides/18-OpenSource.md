## Types of Open Source Software

* Apps/Programs
* Libraries
* Tooling

---

### Licensing

- [GitHub: Licensing a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository)
- [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com)

### Semantic Versioning

- [semver.org](https://semver.org)

### Types of Open Source

* Company supported:
  * Supports business?
  * Comes out of engineering?

* Community
  * Individuals vs. Teams

### Questions to Ask Before using a Library

* How big of a dependency is this?
* How popular and commonly used is it?
* How recently has it been updated and maintained?
* What will happen if this library:
  * goes unmaintained?
  * gets acquired?

<!--
What kind of project are _you_ working on?

Some libraries are relatively trivial. This means that if they go on maintained or if you have problems with them, it’s not that big of a deal to replace, or fork and modify.

Some libraries are much more involved and dependency upon them means that your app is limited by relying on them. The code and the design of your app may be dependent on that library. Use these dependencies more carefully.

Even small libraries can add a significant amount of a value. Details really matter and can make or break an implementation. Good libraries have already dealt with a lot of these details.
-->

---

### Using 3rd Party Libraries

* Don't be afraid to jump into the code!
* Contribute to the library, or make your own fork to fix a problem in an
unmaintained library.
* You can use internal API layers to abstract, and limit the reach of external APIs.


---

### Open Source Authors

* Being an author of open source software can be thankless. Show thanks, and
  treat them with respect.
* The authors and maintainers of open source libraries don’t owe you anything.
  Do not behave like you are entitled to their support.
