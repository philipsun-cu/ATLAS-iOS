### User Interface

- Avoid alert stacking
- Avoid blocking the entire user interface

  * System-Styled Alerts
    * **Pros:**

      - Familiar
      - Easy to implement

    * **Cons:**

### Ideas

- Automatic retry handling. Can you do anything to avoid showing the error to
the user?
- Use alerts and your copy to set the tone and character of your app.
  * Don't be annoying though — this can make a frustrating experience worse.
