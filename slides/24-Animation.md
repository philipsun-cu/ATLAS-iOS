## Random Thoughts

* Transitions vs. On-Screen
* In general, stick with system transitions
* Monospace numbers
* The level of effort required to create animations is now much lower than it
used to be, and the bar is now higher.

## Examples

* Successful actions
* Failed actions
    * Failed passwords
    * Twitter profile when already on that profile
* Spatial context
